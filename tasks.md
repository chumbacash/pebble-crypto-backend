# Project Roadmap & Progress Log

## Goal
- Refactor and expand the pebble-crypto-api project for maintainability, scalability, and advanced analytics.
- Modularize codebase: each file should not exceed 250-280 lines for easier maintenance.
- Add advanced technical indicators, order book analytics, and a powerful AI agent.
- Centralize configuration and improve code structure.

### AI Agent Vision
- **Purpose:** Build a modular AI agent that can answer natural language questions about cryptocurrency markets (e.g., "What is the price of BTC?", "What is the trend for Ethereum?", "Is there a buy wall on the order book?").
- **Capabilities:**
  - Aggregate and explain data from technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.), order book analytics (bid/ask depth, buy/sell walls), and (in the future) sentiment/news analysis.
  - Provide actionable, educational, and explainable insights to help users make informed decisions.
  - Respond in a conversational, user-friendly way, with clear references to the data used.
- **Extensibility:**
  - The agent should be easy to extend with new data sources, analytics modules, or response formats.
  - All logic should be modular, so new features can be added without making any file too large or complex.

  - Moved `services/gemini_insights.py` to `app/core/ai/gemini_client.py`.
  - Moved `services/metrics.py` to `app/services/metrics.py`.
- **Endpoint Refactoring:**
  - Created modular API route files in `app/api/routes/`.
  - Created `app/main.py` as the new application entry point.
  - Moved all API endpoints from `main.py` to their respective route modules.
  - Added proper rate limiting to all endpoints.
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Implemented Bollinger Bands technical indicator in `app/core/indicators/advanced/bollinger_bands.py`.
  - Implemented Average True Range (ATR) indicator in `app/core/indicators/advanced/atr.py`.
  - Implemented Order Book Depth Analyzer in `app/core/indicators/order_book/depth_analyzer.py`.
  - Created the AI agent orchestration logic in `app/core/ai/agent.py`.
  - Added natural language query endpoint at `/api/ask`.
  - Implemented detailed market analysis module for buy/sell advice.
  - Created asset comparison module for analyzing multiple cryptocurrencies.
  - Enhanced natural language query endpoint with Pydantic models for request/response validation.
  - Added context-aware response enhancement for customizing AI responses based on user preferences.
  - Implemented multi-timeframe analysis across 1h, 4h, 1d, and 1w intervals for more comprehensive insights.
  - Enhanced symbol detection for query processing with improved pattern matching for cryptocurrency symbols.
- **Configuration:**
  - Centralized configuration in `app/config.py`, loading from `.env` file.
  - Updated services to use the centralized configuration.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated README.md with the new project structure and features.
  - Updated requirements.txt with pinned dependencies.

## Notes
- All code changes should keep files concise and focused.
- Only relevant comments should be included in code.
- This file is the single source of truth for project progress and roadmap.

## Recent Updates (2024-10-12)
- Optimized API response size by removing OHLCV historical price data from the multi-timeframe results
- Improved response efficiency by keeping only the essential technical indicators and key price metrics for each timeframe
- Reduced response payload size by approximately 80-90% while preserving all critical analytical information
- Enhanced API performance and reduced client-side data processing requirements
- Fixed the way we filter multi-timeframe data to ensure all important trend and volatility data is preserved

## Recent Updates (2024-10-11)
- Fixed critical bug with JSON serialization errors caused by NaN values in prediction results
- Implemented recursive NaN sanitization in both MarketAgent and AdvancedPredictor classes
