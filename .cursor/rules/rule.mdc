I want you to write everything on this task.md, Roadmap on what you want to achieve and what you have done.


You will be required to make edits in the projects, where necessary, and keep updating the task.md until we achieve everything we had intended to do;

- Each file code should not exceed 250 - 280 lines of code, to be easier to maintain and make changes.

- No need to have long and unnecessary comments, make relevant comments ONLY if there is need.

Thank you.
